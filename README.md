Goal:
The document's goal is to describe the Library Management Application's implementation. The library application needs to be created so that users can search for books and authors.

Overview:

This software is a website that can run on local web server inside a library and possibly on internet. The front-end is developed in NetBeans and XAMPP. The backend is developed in java.
The Library Management system has been augmented with fields that are required for performing the functional requirements of the project. However, the schema is designed in such a way that it will be backward compatible.

•	Java: Programming language used.
•	MySQL: MYSQL database is used as a DBMS.
•	JDBC is used to connect MySQL server. The Java API known as JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) controls how to establish a connection to a database, send commands and queries, and handle result sets received from the database.
•	NetBeans: NetBeans is a free, open source, integrated development environment (IDE) that enables you to develop desktop, mobile and web applications. Apache NetBeans provides editors, wizards, and templates to help you create applications in Java, PHP.
•	XAMPP: XAMPP is an abbreviation for cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl. XAMPP is one of the widely used cross-platform web servers, which helps developers to create and test their programs on a local webserver.
